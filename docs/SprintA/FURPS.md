# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:_

- _are common across several US/UC;_
- _are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

(fill in here)

## Usability

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._

(fill in here )

## Reliability

_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._

(fill in here )

## Performance

_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._

(fill in here )

## Supportability

_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._

### Design Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the system design process. Examples may include: programming languages, software process, mandatory standards/patterns, use of development tools, class library, etc._

| Category | Description |
|-|-|
| Programming languages and paradigms | The application must be developed in Java, using an objected-oriented procedure. |
| Mandatory standards/patterns | During the design process, as well as in the development process, the team must adopt recognized code standards, which should be used in all documents created in the project. Those standards must also be used in commit messages, in order to easily locate and manage changes in the source code. |
| Security restrictions | When it comes to the security of the app data, the application must require a password for everyone that uses the software, which must contain seven alphanumeric characters, including three capital letters and two digits. Regarding privacy of user’s information, only nurses should access user’s health data. |
| Language requirements | The app must offer all contents in English and Portuguese. |

### Implementation Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the code or construction of a system such
such as: mandatory standards/patterns, implementation languages,
database integrity, resource limits, operating system._

| Category | Description |
|-|-|
| Programming languages | For the implementation process, there are constraints about the programming languages and the software that the team can use. Java must be used to develop the application, using JavaFX 11 for the graphical interface. |
| Development tools and frameworks | The Client also requested that the development team must use either IntelliJ IDE or NetBeans IDE for writing and managing the app source code. For code documentation, the Javadoc plugin must be used. The development team should implement unit tests for all methods developed, which must be done using JUnit 5 framework. JaCoCo plugin must also be used, but only for generating test’s reports. |
| File formats | If there are any images generated by the application, they must be saved in SVG format. Pictures created during the development process should also use the same format. |

### Interface Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the features inherent to the interaction of the
system being developed with other external systems._

| Category | Description |
|-|-|
| External resources | The Client has required that the application should send multiple notifications to the user via SMS or email. These notifications can be sent using external software, such as plugins or libraries. After taking the vaccine, the user can request the European Union COVID digital certificate. This document will be generated by an external source, which is going to be implemented by the DGS’s IT department. |

### Physical Constraints

_Specifies a limitation or physical requirement regarding the hardware used to house the system, as for example: material, shape, size or weight._

Our team did not find any kind of physical requirements in the information provided by the Client.
